                    <h3>Ambition.</h3>
                        <p>Getting to the top takes effort. If you want success, you have to be willing to work for it.
                            Being a
                            hard
                            worker isn’t an easy title to earn. Even if you don’t get it, you have to try your hardest.
                            Give it
                            your
                            all and don’t let failure stop you. You can learn from your mistakes.</p>
                        <h3>Relentlessness.</h3>
                        <p>You have to have the attitude of a champion. Having the attitude of a fighter. Choose to
                            fight back
                            against these impending odds. If you get knocked down, say to yourself that you will try
                            your hardest
                            to
                            keep on going.</p>
                        <h3>Acceptance.</h3>
                        <p>Know that you might fail, and accept the fact that if you do, you’re not just going to sit
                            and pout.
                            That
                            you’re going to keep on trying until you can taste success.</p>
                        <h3>Respect.</h3>
                        <p>Give respect to get respect. Respect co-workers, family, friends and even strangers, and
                            they will
                            respect
                            you. As Tecumseh once said, "Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their
                            view, and
                            demand
                            that they respect yours. Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your
                            life. Seek to
                            make
                            your life long and its purpose in the service of your people".</p>
                        <p>Your life has meaning to it. Your life is worth living. Finding your purpose isn’t easy.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>"Small minds can't comprehend big spirits. To be great you have to be willing to be
                                mocked, hated and misunderstood. Stay strong."</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>The relationships that you have with your peers can put you the wringer. They can mess with
                            your
                            emotions,
                            question your beliefs, and sometimes stop you from making your dreams come true. They can
                            put
                            restrictions
                            on your goals and the motivation you need to succeed. The only barriers that should be on
                            you are the
                            ones
                            you make. Not the ones put onto you by your peers. Success is caused by the people who you
                            surround
                            yourself with. The people who you surround yourself with, the people who you
                            associate yourself
                            with matters.</p>
                        <p>There are always going to be people in your life who are doubters. If you believe those who
                            doubt you
                            then
                            you’ll give up on yourself. On the other hand, if you surround yourself with greatness,
                            then you’ll
                            succeed. Your time is limited, don’t waste it doing a job that you hate or following a
                            career that was
                            picked out for you by a girlfriend, boyfriend, parent or friend. Do you want to be lying on
                            your death
                            bed
                            knowing that your life was chosen for you by others? Or do you want to die knowing that you
                            lived a
                            life
                            well lived? A life that was yours to begin with.</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Do what you love. Will it be hard? Yes. Can you do it? Yes.</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>You don’t have to be an entrepreneur to succeed. By following the career that you love,
                            you’re already a
                            winner. You’re doing something that many others have tried and failed at. Be proud of what
                            you have
                            accomplished.</p>
                        <p>There is a place for you and what you want to do. No matter what anyone tells you,
                            you are here
                            for
                            a reason and that reason is important. Whether it’s a waitress, teacher, clerk
                            or even a
                            janitor, there is a place for all of you. Without you going out there and doing what you
                            love, society
                            wouldn’t exist. Our infrastructure wouldn’t exist. Societies were built by the workers, and
                            not just
                            ordinary workers, hard workers. Workers who never gave in or gave up. Workers who worked
                            and came home
                            to
                            work some more. All for a purpose. Just by breathing you’re serving a purpose.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, if you’re just lying around and doing nothing, you’re not serving a
                            purpose. You’re
                            not
                            serving society. By choosing to do nothing to help society and others progress is useless.
                            A purpose is
                            doing something that you know in your heart is your life's work. To do something that makes
                            a
                            difference
                            for yourself and others too. A job that helps others, that gives others a reason to live,
                            to survive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You don’t have to be Gandhi to make a difference. Does it help? Yes, but to make a
                            difference, all you have to do is have a positive attitude towards life, towards getting up
                            in the morning and going to work and doing it all over again the next day. Even Gandhi had
                            his ups and downs. But he didn’t give up. No matter how hard it got, he didn’t give up. He
                            chose to resist temptation and chose to defy the status quo.

                            In the end – Life is whatever you make it out to be. The question is... <b><i>What are you
                                    going to do with your life?</i></b>
                        </p>
