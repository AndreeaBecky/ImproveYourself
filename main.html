                            <p>Can a poor person become wealthy? Of course! The unique combination of desire, planning,
                                effort and perseverance will always work its magic. The question is not whether the
                                formula for success will work, but rather whether the person will work the formula.
                                That is the unknown variable. That is the challenge that confronts us all.</p>
                            <h2>Here is how you can do that—10 ways to improve your life:</h2>

                            <h3><strong>1. Face your fears</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                That’s how you conquer them. Don’t dismiss them; face them. Say, Here’s what I’m afraid
                                of. I wonder what I could do to change that.
                                Face your fears today.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>2. Exercise your willpower to change direction</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                You don’t have to keep doing what you’ve been doing the last six years if it’s not
                                yielding the benefits you want. Pick a new destination and
                                go that way. Use
                                your willpower to start the process. You don’t have to repeat last year. Clean up the
                                errors. Invest it now in the next year. Watch it make the
                                difference.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>3. Admit your mistakes</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                Sometimes you have to admit them to others. Here’s one of the best phrases in the
                                English language: “I’m sorry.” Those words could start a whole new
                                relationship.
                                They could start two people going in a whole new direction. Admit your mistakes to
                                yourself. You don’t have to babble about them to everyone in the
                                neighborhood. But it
                                doesn’t hurt you to sit down and have a conversation with yourself and say, There’s
                                no
                                use kidding myself. Here’s where I really am. I’ve got pennies
                                in my pocket and I’ve
                                got nothing in the bank. That’s what I said after a Girl Scout left my door. I had
                                a
                                conversation with myself and I said, I don’t want this to happen
                                anymore.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>4. Refine your goals</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                Start the process. Set some higher goals. Reach for some higher purpose. Go for
                                something beyond what you thought you could do.
                            </p>

                            <h3><strong>5. Believe in yourself</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                You’ve got to believe in the possibilities. You’ve got to believe that tomorrow can be
                                better than today. Believe in yourself. There isn’t a skill you
                                can’t learn; there isn’t a discipline you can’t try; there isn’t a class you can’t
                                take; there isn’t a book you couldn’t read.
                            </p>

                            <h3><strong>6. Ask for wisdom</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                Ask for wisdom that creates answers. Ask for wisdom to deal with the challenges for
                                today and tomorrow. Don’t wish it was easier; wish you were better.
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>7. Conserve your time</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                Sometimes we get faked out. Motivational speaker Bill Bailey says the average person
                                says, “I’ve got 20 more years.” But Bill says you’ve got
                                20 more times. If you go fishing once a year, you’ve only got 20 more times to go
                                fishing, not 20 years. That fakes you out
                            </p>
                            <h3><strong>9. Live with intensity</strong></h3>
                            <p>You might as well turn it up a notch or two. Invest more of you in whatever you do. Be
                                a little stronger; be a little wiser. Step up your
                                vitality contribution. Put everything you’ve got into everything you do and then ask
                                for more vitality, more strength and more vigor, more
                                heart and more soul.
                            </p>

                            <h3><strong>10. Find your place</strong></h3>
                            <p>
                                If you just work at a job, find the best place you can serve well, and sure
                                enough they’ll ask you to occupy a better place. Keep doing
                                a job well; do the very best you can. That’s your best way out.
                            </p>
