                    <p>
                        Why? People tend to make four basic mistakes that stall their progress. Let’s explore these
                        mistakes so you can avoid them and unleash your personal momentum.
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="margin-top: 30px;">1. Stop stalling and decide!</h3>
                    <p>The more choices we have, the harder it is to choose any particular one. Call it paralysis
                        by analysis. When some people face multiple options, they freeze, become overwhelmed and
                        are unable to make a choice. In this situation, I think about the words of Socrates. “To
                        move the world, we must first move ourselves.”

                        Each of us has an inner voice that guides our decisions. Listen to it. Trust it. Taking a
                        first step is like the nudge that gets the snowball rolling.

                        Will your choice be perfect? No. But you’ll get a lot further in life moving imperfectly
                        than you will by sitting around charting out the ideal course. Remember, you can always
                        adjust and change your direction.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. Quit wasting time.</h3>
                    <p>All of us are allotted the same 1,440 minutes in a day. Sounds like a lot, right? But we
                        know how quickly those minutes zip by and how easy it is to lose five here, 10 there and 20
                        somewhere else. If we all have the same limited amount of time each day to reach our
                        potential, why do some people succeed and others don’t?

                        It comes down to planning. Projects usually are more difficult, take longer and cost more
                        than we anticipate. You have to be deliberate in the way you spend your time and stay
                        realistic about what you can accomplish.

                        When you excel at managing time, you can maximize your potential and minimize your
                        frustration. One of my favorite time-management strategies is to ask myself before taking
                        on a task: <br>
                        <i><b style="margin-left: 50px;">Will doing this help me fulfill my potential?</b></i>
                        <br>
                        You’d be surprised how much I eliminate when I realize the answer is no.
                    </p>
                    <h3>3. Sharpen your problem-solving</h3>
                    <p>Make no mistake, problems will find you! The way you handle them will either limit or
                        enhance your potential. You can see problems as opportunities for wisdom and growth that
                        spark kinetic energy or as obstacles that prevent momentum.

                        Face problems creatively. Don’t allow them to put the brakes on your progress. Search out
                        the things you can gain from your problems. I have learned much more from failing than I
                        have from succeeding!
                    </p>
                    <h3>4.Let’s get rolling!</h3>
                    <p>The wonderful thing about potential is that it can build upon itself. If you can just get
                        the snowball rolling, the energy of motion will take over.

                        Think for a moment about the people you respect. Why do you admire them? You are probably
                        drawn to them because they are full of realized potential. When we see people exerting this
                        kind of energy, it compels us to draw ourselves closer to them and become a part of what
                        they are doing.
                    </p>
                    <p>So today you have a choice. Will you sit at the top of the hill merely contemplating your
                        capabilities? Or will you give yourself a little shove and barrel down that hill, knocking
                        over obstacles standing in your way?
                    </p>
